# Sparse Normal Plane Constrained Trajectory Optimization (SNPCT)

This repository provides the core implementation of the method proposed in our paper, specifically corresponding to **Section III**.

üöß **Note**: Currently, only the core part of the code is publicly available. The full software package and detailed usage tutorials will be released upon official acceptance of the paper.

## Overview

This work introduces **Sparse Normal Plane Constrained Trajectory (SNPCT)** representation for trajectory planning in structured environments. The approach offers two main advantages:

- **Sparse parameterization**: Ensures low computational complexity.
- **Explicit lateral deviation representation**: Enables direct embedding of trajectory-reference deviation into the optimization problem.

Based on SNPCT, we formulate and solve the path-velocity coupled trajectory planning problem with enhanced performance in curvature minimization and stability along reference paths.
